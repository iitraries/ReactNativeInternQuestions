React Native Android Intern – Interview Preparation

A curated, structured collection of interview questions specifically designed for React Native Android Developer Intern roles.

- Students who know React Native but not native Android (Kotlin/Java)
- Candidates who want to sound aware, not clueless, in Android interviews
- Anyone aiming to maximize selection probability, not just pass technical rounds
