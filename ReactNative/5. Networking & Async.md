**Category purpose:** Data handling (Data flow from API → UI)
## A. API → UI Data Flow (Core)
1. Walk through the **complete data flow** from triggering an API request to rendering the result on the screen in a React Native app.
2. Where should **networking logic live** in a React Native app, and why is placing it directly inside UI components risky?
3. How do you decide what belongs in **API response state** versus **derived UI state**?

### B. `fetch` vs Axios (Conceptual, Not API Trivia)
4. What are the **practical differences** between `fetch` and Axios that matter in production apps?
5. Why does `fetch` require **manual error handling**, and what problems does that introduce if done incorrectly?
6. In what situations would choosing Axios be a **bad decision**?

---

### C. Async / Await & Control Flow
7. What happens if an async function throws an error and it is **not explicitly handled**?
8. Why is mixing `.then()` chains with `async/await` considered a code smell?
9. How does JavaScript’s event loop affect **network request timing** in React Native?

---

### D. Loading, Error, and Retry States
10. Why is representing loading state as a **boolean** often insufficient?
11. What UX and logic bugs occur when loading and error states are **not reset correctly**?
12. How would you design a retry mechanism without causing **duplicate requests or loops**?

---

### E. Race Conditions (Selection Booster)
13. What is a **race condition** in the context of API calls in React Native?
14. How can multiple in-flight requests cause the UI to display **incorrect or stale data**?
15. Why do race conditions appear more frequently on **slow networks or low-end devices**?

---

### F. Cancellation & Cleanup (Selection Booster)
16. Why is request cancellation important when screens unmount or parameters change?
17. What problems occur if an API response tries to update state **after a component has unmounted**?
18. How does cleanup logic in `useEffect` help prevent **memory leaks and invalid state updates**?

---

### G. Real-World Debugging & Reliability
19. How would you debug an issue where an API works in development but **fails intermittently in production**?
20. What are common beginner mistakes when handling async data that only show up **under real user behavior**?
